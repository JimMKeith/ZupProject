<p>This is a new site dedicated to providing a platform for artists to expose their work. It does not currently attempt to sell any contibuted items. When and if it does in the future it will be in collaboration with the contributors setting price, revenue sharing and terms of sale.</p> 

<p>What it can do for you is offer exposure and links to other sites such as facebook and youtube where you may work to aquire a large audience.</p> 

<p>All this is FREE of charge to you. Get in now while this is still the case. There may in the future be a subscription fees but as an early adopter those fees for you will be waved. FREE for life.</p>
